# Snake Game using Q-Learning Model
## Overview

I am thrilled to share with you my very first Reinforcement Learning model! 

The game used in this project is the popular 90's "Snake Game". As it is my first time coding a python game, I was inspired by the work of Patrick Loeber and Michael Sequin. [This is the link of their version of the game and AI Model](https://github.com/python-engineer/snake-ai-pytorch). 

Although both our codes share many similarities, I have added my own touch and made major modifications both on the game environment and the AI agent.

The similarities and the differences are detailed below.
